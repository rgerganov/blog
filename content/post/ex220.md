Large telecoms in Bulgaria are also ISPs and there is a common practice to give out "free" Wi-Fi routers to customers.
[Last time](/post/smartcom-wpa) I wrote about the Smartcom Ralink router and its insecure default Wi-Fi passwords.
This time I will look into the [TP-Link EX220 router](https://help.a1.bg/internet/fixed-internet/wireless-routers/tp-link-ex220/initial-setup) which is being deployed by [A1](https://www.a1.bg/).

{{% fluid_img class="pure-u-1-1" src="/images/ex220.png" title="TP-Link EX220" %}}

My main motivation for this research was their ridiculous policy of forcing customers to use this router and not allowing them to use their own.
A1 also refuses to provide admin credentials for the router and people are forced to call their support for simple tasks like changing the Wi-Fi SSID.
This is both inconvenient and terrible from privacy and security perspective.

## Getting root access

First thing, of course, is to open the router and try to find UART header for serial console.
The UART pinout is pretty obvious, we just need to solder a header to the PCB:

[{{% fluid_img class="pure-u-1-1" src="/images/ex220-uart-small.jpg" %}}](/images/ex220-uart.jpg "Serial console")

The serial console works but it ends up with a login prompt. I tried some default credentials for `root` and `admin` with no success. Fortunately, the bootloader (u-boot) is accessible and it allows loading custom firmware images.
I downloaded [initramfs](https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/24.10.0/targets/ramips/mt7621/openwrt-24.10.0-ramips-mt7621-tplink_ex220-v1-initramfs-kernel.bin) image from [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) and uploaded it using the XMODEM protocol (TFTP didn't work for some reason). It booted successfully and I got access to the device and its flash.

The next step was to dump the flash partitions and analyze them. There are 13 partitions in total, but only 2 of them are interesting (`rootfs` and `config`):

```sh
root@OpenWrt:~# cat /proc/mtd
dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00030000 00010000 "boot"
mtd1: 00010000 00010000 "boot-env"
mtd2: 00010000 00010000 "factory"
mtd3: 00010000 00010000 "config"
mtd4: 00010000 00010000 "isp_config"
mtd5: 00010000 00010000 "rom_file"
mtd6: 00010000 00010000 "cloud"
mtd7: 00020000 00010000 "radio"
mtd8: 00010000 00010000 "config_bak"
mtd9: 00f30000 00010000 "firmware"
mtd10: 003e0000 00010000 "kernel"
mtd11: 00b50000 00010000 "rootfs"
mtd12: 00020000 00010000 "rootfs_data"
```

`rootfs` is squashfs image with the root filesystem and `config` stores the configuration of the device.

The rootfs has no `/etc/shadow`, only `/etc/passwd` with the following users:

```
admin:I55OiXWnKr89Y:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
dropbear:x:500:500:dropbear:/var/tmp/dropbear:/bin/sh
nobody:*:0:0:nobody:/:/bin/sh
```

It took me ~20min to crack the `admin` password with [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and RTX 3090 -- it is **`spbu100e`**. Now I can login as `admin` on the serial console with the default firmware.

The next step was to find how the router configuration is stored in the `config` partition (`rootfs` is read-only).
Turns out it is encrypted with AES-128-CBC and both key and IV are hardcoded in `/lib/libcmm.so`:

```
key: 1528632946736109
 IV: 1528632946736539
```

Dumping the partition to a file and decrypting it with `openssl` could be done with:

```sh
$ openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in config.bin -out config.dec --nopad -K 31353238363332393436373336313039 -iv 31353238363332393436373336353339
```

and it _almost_ works. We get plaintext mixed with binary data which probably means they are using some custom format after decryption. Instead of reversing this crap I thought why not just use the original library to dump the configuration for me.
There is `dm_dumpCfg()` function in `libcmm.so` and it appears to be doing exactly that. All I need to do is to build a small binary which loads the library and calls this function.

## Toolchain

The architecture is MIPS and they are using [uClibc](https://uclibc-ng.org/) v1.0.14.
There are several toolchains for compiling programs with uClibc but the top choice is [OpenADK](https://openadk.org/) which is developed by the same people who created uClibc.

Building the OpenADK toolchain was surprisingly easy. I just had to specify the exact version of uClibc, patch available
[here](https://github.com/rgerganov/openadk/tree/ex220).


## Dumping the configuration

With some trial and error I came up with this simple program which loads the library and successfully dumps the configuration:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

typedef int (*dm_shmInit_fun)(int);
typedef int (*dm_loadCfg_fun)();
typedef int (*dm_dumpCfg_fun)();

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    void *handle = dlopen("/lib/libcmm.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf(stderr, "dlopen failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    dm_shmInit_fun dm_shmInit = dlsym(handle, "dm_shmInit");
    dm_loadCfg_fun dm_loadCfg = dlsym(handle, "dm_loadCfg");
    dm_dumpCfg_fun dm_dumpCfg = dlsym(handle, "dm_dumpCfg");
    if (!dm_shmInit || !dm_loadCfg || !dm_dumpCfg) {
        fprintf(stderr, "dlsym failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    dm_shmInit(0);
    dm_loadCfg();
    dm_dumpCfg();
    return 0;
}
```

Build and publish on the host:

```sh
$OPENADK_ROOT/toolchain_generic-mips_uclibc-ng_mips32r2el_soft/usr/mipsel-openadk-linux-uclibc/bin/gcc -o dumpcfg dumpcfg.c -ldl
python3 -m http.server
```

Download and run on the router:

```bash
curl --output dumpcfg http://192.168.0.2:8000/dumpcfg
chmod +x dumpcfg
export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libgdpr.so:/lib/libcutil.so:/lib/libmapShared.so:/lib/libos.so:/lib/libxml.so:/lib/libcmm.so
./dumpcfg
```

The result is a giant XML which contains the entire configuration of the router. Here are some interesting parts:

```xml
<Device>
...
  <DeviceInfo>
    <ManufacturerOUI>F0A731</ManufacturerOUI>
    <X_TP_DeviceModel>EX220(EU)</X_TP_DeviceModel>
    <SerialNumber>REDACTED</SerialNumber>
    <HardwareVersion>EX220 v1.0 00000000</HardwareVersion>
    <SoftwareVersion>A1.EX220.016</SoftwareVersion>
    <ProvisioningCode>1</ProvisioningCode>
    <UpTime>7</UpTime>
    <X_TP_ConfigVersion>1509949442</X_TP_ConfigVersion>
  </DeviceInfo>
  ...
  <X_TP_UserCfg>
    <AdminName>root</AdminName>
    <AdminPwd>aDm1n$TR8r</AdminPwd>
    <UserEnable>0</UserEnable>
    <UserRemoteEnable>0</UserRemoteEnable>
  </X_TP_UserCfg>
  ...
</Device>
```

User `root` and password `aDm1n$TR8r` are the default credentials for the web interface.
Now even if the ISP changes the password (via [TR-069](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069)), we can always dump the configuration and get it back!

This completes the quest of having full control over this router.

## SSH access

Having root access on the serial console is great but it is not very convenient. SSH access would be much better.
The default firmware has dropbear SSH server but it [doesn't give shell access](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/2462/). OK, then let's build our own `dropbear` which gives shell access.
Checkout my [OpenADK fork](https://github.com/rgerganov/openadk/tree/ex220) and run:

```sh
$ make package=dropbear clean package
```

Update the `rootfs` image with the new `dropbear` binary and flash it back:

```sh
# Host side
unsquashfs -d rootfs-work partitions/rootfs.bin
cp $OPENADK_ROOT/target_generic-mips_uclibc-ng_mips32r2el_soft/usr/sbin/dropbear rootfs-work/usr/bin/dropbearmulti
mksquashfs rootfs-work rootfs-patched.squashfs -b 262144 -comp xz
python3 -m http.server

# Router side
curl --output rootfs.bin http://192.168.1.10:8000/rootfs-patched.squashfs
mtd -r write rootfs.bin rootfs
```

## WPS PIN generation

Finally, let's look at the WPS PIN generation. We have this page in the Web UI which allows us to generate a new WPS PIN:

{{% fluid_img class="pure-u-1-1" src="/images/ex220-wps.png" title="WPS PIN" %}}

[Alex Stanev](https://sec.stanev.org/) found this nice function in the `libcmm.so` library:

{{% fluid_img class="pure-u-1-1" src="/images/ex220-wps-gen.png" title="WPS PIN Generation" %}}

It initializes the random number generator with the current time and then calls `rand()` to get the WPS PIN (the last digit is a checksum). Let's verify this with a simple C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    srand(atoi(argv[1]));
    printf("rand() = %d\n", rand());
    return 0;
}
```

I clicked the "Generate" button in the Web UI at 2025-04-06 12:40:40 and I got the WPS PIN `69636486`.
Converting the timestamp to seconds since epoch gives us `1743932440` which is the input for `srand()`:

```sh
$ ./rand 1743932440
rand() = 669636489
```

The last digit is a checksum and the WPS PIN is `69636486` which is exactly what I got from the Web UI.

Oh, and one last thing. The default WiFi password is the same as the default WPS PIN.
How to exploit this is left as an exercise for the reader.
